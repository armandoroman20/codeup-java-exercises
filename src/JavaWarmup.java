//    Define the following terms and cite a specific example for each...
    //    Encapsulation - Using getter and setter on a private field
    //    Inheritance - lets programmers create new classes that share attributes of existing classes
    //    Polymorphism - lets programmers use the same word to mean different things in different contexts.
    //    One form of polymorphism in Java is method overloading.
    //    Abstraction -
//    What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
        // Overloading is when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
        // Overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided its parent class.
//    What are four types of visibility in Java?
        /*private
        public
        protected
        package protected
         */
//    Under what conditions would using a map collection be preferred over a list collection and vice versa?
    // collection is using key value pairs
//    What are three differences between abstract classes and interfaces?
    /* interfaces
    all methods are public and abstract.
    all properties are public static and final.
    no static methods.
     */
//    What are annotations and what are some specific examples?
    // Annotations are used to provide metadata for Java code
    //@Entity
    //@TextTransformation
//    What is the difference between a checked and an unchecked exception?
    // The main difference between checked and unchecked exception is that the checked exceptions are checked at compile-time while unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime.
//    What is the difference between the 'throw' and 'throws' keywords in Java?
    // Throw keyword is used in the method body to throw an exception, while throws is used in method signature to declare the exceptions that can occur in the statements present in the method.
